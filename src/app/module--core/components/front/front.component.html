				<p>The Delhi Capitals will look to find form when they take on Gujarat Giants at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in their own city on Tuesday. The team will be playing at their home ground for the first time in four years. (More Cricket News)
          Speaking ahead of the game the DC Director of Cricket Sourav Ganguly said, "Anrich Nortje is here, but we haven't picked the team yet. Khaleel and Mukesh bowled well against Lucknow. Sakariya bowled well in his first two overs but went for a few runs in his last two, which can happen in T20 cricket. We have the required attack, hopefully, we'll be fine against Gujarat."</p>

        <p>Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions).[1] This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.</p>

        <p>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.</p>
